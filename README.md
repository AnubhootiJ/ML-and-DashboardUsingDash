Code for Deployed dash project with ML model

# About the Project -
The following project includes the code for the deployed dashboard along with the ML model to predict the earthquake. The ML model
isn't deployed on the website because of the large size of the model. The website is a multi-page dashboard with data about past 
earthquakes around the Indian subcontinent and Delhi health statistics. It also depicts top diseases by month, by region, most earthquake-
prone areas, graphs and maps. The project is deployed on Heroku. 

# The files this repository include are -
- Assets -> the folder contains stylesheet file for the website.
- Scraping -> the folder contains python scripts for scraping Earthquake data. 
- app.py -> Dash file
- header.py -> Header and title bar component, common to all the pages.
- index.py -> Dash file, running the server for app.
- layouts.py -> The different HTML components in respect with Dash.
- callbacks.py -> Python functions used to make the dashboard interactive.
